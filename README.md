## Running this code
Our code is compatible with Python 2.7.12 & 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.3.0. In addition, [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) will be required to generate data.

### Generating Data
We make use of data generators to generate the TFRecords that are used for training. Of particular note is [`cipher_generator`](https://github.com/for-ai/CipherGAN/data/data_generators/cipher_generator.py), which may be used to generate data for the shift and Vigenère ciphers that were tested in the paper.

#### Sample Call
The settings for the included generators are passed as flags. For example, to generate a word-level Vigenère Cipher (key:`CDE`) on the Brown Corpus with a sample length of 200, call:
```
python cipher_generator.py --cipher=vigenere --vigenere_key=345 --percentage_training=0.9 --corpus=brown --vocab_size=200 --test_name=vigenere345-brown200-eval --train_name=vigenere345-brown200-train --output_dir=/tmp/data --vocab_filename=viginere345_brown200_vocab.txt
```

### Training
All training can be performed by calling `train.py`. Training requires the TFRecords generated by the included generators.

#### Sample Call
Please refer to the flags accepted by `train.py` for a full set of options.
```
python -m CipherGAN.train --output_dir=runs/vig345 --test_name="vigenere345-brown200-eval*" --train_name="vigenere345-brown200-train*"
```
